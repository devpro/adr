# Markdown code execution ADR - September, 2024

## Context and problem statement

As a technical writer, I want to be able to execute the code blocks included in a Markdown page so that I can improve the user experience of the person that will be following the documentation.

## Requirements

* Execute in one click the code in a terminal that would have been opened and selected before
* Must work in Visual Studio Code or integrated in a solution to provide the HTML from the Markdown
* Technical solution must be free of charge

## Considered options

Name                             | Sources                                                    | IDE
---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------
[Runme](https://docs.runme.dev/) | [:octocat:](https://github.com/coder/code-server) _â˜… 1.1k_ | Visual Studio Code
